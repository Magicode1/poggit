            <p>After a plugin developer submits a plugin to Poggit, it will be reviewed by Code Reviewers and Test
                Reviewers before it can be used by the public. Therefore, released plugins you download from Poggit are
                considered to be safe to use, and quality is generally promising. More information on Plugin Reviewal 
                guidlines can be found 
                <a href="../releases/submit/SubmitPluginModule.php">Here</a>.</p>
            <p>The plugin index is categorized, and each released plugin is versioned. You can also filter them by type
                of <span title="A spoon is a variant of PocketMine-MP. Examples include pmmp, Genisys, ClearSky, etc."
                         class="hover-title">spoon</span> that you use, number of downloads, ratings, etc.</p>

            <p>Poggit CI will set up webhooks in your repos to link to Poggit. When you push a commit to your repo,
                Poggit will create a development build. When you receive pull requests, Poggit also creates PR builds,
                so you can test the pull request by downloading a build from Poggit CI directly.</p>
            <p>Different plugin frameworks are supported. Currently, the normal one with a <code
                    class="code">plugin.yml</code>, and the NOWHERE framework, can be used.</p>
            <p>An online language manager can also be enabled. After you push some language files to your repo, there
                will be a webpage for online translator, and other people can help you translate your plugin to other
                languages. Then the poglang library will be compiled with your plugin, along with some language files
                contributed by the community.</p>

            <p>After Poggit CI creates a build for your project, it will also execute lint on it. Basically, lint is
                something that checks if your code is having problems. See <a
                    href="<?= Poggit::getRootPath() ?>help.lints">Poggit Help: Lint</a> for what the lint checks.</p>
            <p>You can check out the lint result on the Poggit Build page. The lint result will also be uploaded to
                GitHub, in the form of status checks, which will do
                <a target="_blank" href="<?= Poggit::getRootPath() ?>ghhst">many cool things</a>.</p>
            <p class="remark">Note: Poggit cannot test the builds for you, but there is a script that you can put into
                your
                <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/">Travis-CI</a> build, which will wait for and
                then download builds from Poggit for testing.</p>
